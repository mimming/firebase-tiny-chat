Firebase Tiny Chat
======================

It's a tiny chat program. And by tiny, I mean like one page.

I wrote it for live coding at neoHack2014

You can see it live at https://neohack-chat.firebaseapp.com/

## What's here
I do code tutorials like a cooking show demo: with known 'good' safe points. There's an HTML file for each one of these:

- [`index.html`](/index.html) - The starting point: a JQuery Hello World
- [`phase1.html`](/phase1.html) - The minimum functioning chat program
- [`phase2-auth.html`](/phase2-auth.html) - The same simple chat, enhanced with Facebook login for identity
